\section{Methods \label{sec:methods}}

Data was created and modified to be used only for example purposes.  

Data analysis was done in 
R version 3.0.2 (2013-09-25)~\cite{R-base}.  Survival analysis
was done using the {\tt survival} pacakge~\cite{R-survival} with the default
Efron method for tie handling in the Cox proportional hazard models.  Graphics
were produced via the {\tt ggplot2} package~\cite{R-ggplot2}.
